# Full React App: catch of the day
About: This app was created with the goal of experiencing and learning about working with React, a database, 
improving a user experience and implementing useful tools that I see on reputable sites.
--------------------------------------------
**notice: In order to know how to fully use the code, you will need to use the following tools:
1. Database - I'm using firebase
2. Need to install node modules
3. Run on the terminal:"npm run watch"
